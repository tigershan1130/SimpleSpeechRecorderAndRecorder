# SimpleSpeechRecorderAndRecorder
recording speech, custom trim of the wav, training commands, etc. uses Google Tensorflow's mini_speech_commands source


I used http://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/mini_speech_commands.zip 
to train models using train.py you can modify to use any of your own training libaries.

Open VoiceEvaluator.py and modify command list to your respect training libaries command lists.

Use recorder to record your own voice to evaluate against your predicted model.
